After a successful attack roll, the target of the attack makes a Reflex check to determine if they can mitigate or negate the damage.
The Reflex mechanic has three outlets: Block, Dodge, and Parry.
    - Blocked attacks absorb [70-100]% + [X] of the incoming attack's damage.
    - Dodged attacks are immediately escaped and may grant an opportunity for the player's character to move one space.
    - Parried attacks negate the damage and offer a chance for the target to counter the attack.
  
Each character has 4 attributes:
    - ARCANA
    - CHI
    - GUILE
    - POWER
  
One of these four attributes will be the character's main attribute (MAINATT).
  
Each character has a DEFENSE score, which is:
    ( CHI * 0.3 ) + ( GUILE * 0.3 ) + ( MAINATT * 0.4 )
    
    Using the MAINATT in this way will make "glass cannon" builds more survivable. Players will still need to consider defenses, but if they don't, they at least have a fightning chance.
  
Each character has a RawScore, which is:
    ( GUILE + ( POWER / 3 ) + LVL + DEFENSE ) * RawScoreMultiplier
  
A character's Reflex score is:
    ( ( RawScore - Weight ) / ( RawScore + 100 ) ) * 0.75
  
    Weight in the above formula refers to the summed weight of all the character's equipped items.
    The above formula self-caps at 75% maximum reflex chance, allowing for sustainable end-game defense without becoming invulnerable.

As stated above, there are three types of reflex. Each has a rating, which is added in the Reflex formula to the RawScore:
    ( ( RawScore + Rating - Weight ) / (RawScore + Rating + 100 ) ) * 0.75
  
The only notable difference between the three reflexes lies in Blocking. Because blocking will be primarily designed for characters who will make use of Power, the RawScore uses ( POWER / 2 ) instead of ( POWER / 3 ) for Block calculations. This will allow Power based characters to dump points into Power without having to allocate points to Guile for the sole purpose of defense.


Below will be some sample character sheets with calculations.

Parry Rating: 16
Parry Mult: 1.15

Block%: 30.86%
Dodge%: 33.26%
Parry%: 39.21%

________________________

As you can see in the above characters, the percentages reflect the hero's ability to respond to incoming threats. The order of events for Reflex will be:

On a successful attack, the amount of reflex options are checked. If more than one are available (a player can Block or Dodge, for example), a method/algorithm will determine the one with the highest odds (or we could let the player decide). Then reflex will be rolled. A d10K is rolled and it has to be within the percentage (A Parry% of 39.21% must roll a 3921 or lower).

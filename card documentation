              Key-value pairs that provide information about the target of the effect. The target keyword has nine arguments: is_creature, is_self, num_of_targs, range, area, arc, cone, zone, and aura.


              is_creature (bool)

              cone (int)
                    How far on the board the effect goes in a cone. A value of 1 affects only 1 space in front of the player and is equivalent to a melee basic attack.

        ]

When a card is played, default values should be assumed and then written over by the values provided by the card object. The above card then should be able to be written as follows:


{
	“name”: “sample_card_0”,
	“id_no”: “FFC580D4”,
	“title”: “Sample Card”,
	“description”: “This card does nothing.”,
	“flavor”: “You wave your hands over your head calling upon the ancient spirits for aid and... nothing. They’re sleeping again!”,
	“img”: “/data/imgs/sample_card_0.png”,
	“card_type”: “ability”,
	“keywords”: [ “attack” , “wimpy” , “foobar” ],
	“ep_cost”: 2,
	“effect”: [
		{
			“effect_name”: “doNotTouch”,
			“effect_info”: {
				“stop plz”: “now”,
				“hasBeenTouched”: true
			}
		}
	],
	“reqs”: [
		{
			“or_gate”: {
				“min”: 1,
				“conditions”: {
					“player_is_dumb”: false,
					“player_is_cool”: quiteFalse,
					“player_ep_is_ge”: 2  
				}
			}
		}
	],
	“prereqs”: [
		{
			“two_gates”: true,
			“or_gate”: {
				“min”: 2,
				“conditions”: {
					“this_looks_familiar”: true,
					“have_seen_before”: true,
					“remember_where”: false
				}
			},
			“and_gate”: {
				“number_of_times_seen_ge”: 1
			}
		}
	]
}

________________
card.effect Methods
damage[b]
Used to make an attack against a target. The damage() method takes the following arguments:


damage_amount (str)
The amount of damage to be dealt to the target. The value should be expressible as an integer or in dice notation.
Default: 0


damage_min (int)
The minimum amount of damage that this attack will deliver, regardless of the value of damage_amount.
Default: 0


Damage_max (int)
The maximum amount of damage that this attack will deliver, regardless of the value of damage_amount. A value of null means no cap is placed on damage dealt. 
Default: null


damage_type (str)
The type of damage that will be dealt.
Default: “dmgWeapon”


damage_on_miss (int)
The amount of damage dealt even if the attack misses. If the value is a float, it represents the percentage of the damage that would have been dealt if the attack passed that will be dealt to the target.
Default: 0


Sample: {
        “effect_name”: “damage”,
        “effect_info”: {
                “damage_amount”: “2d8”,
                “damage_min”: 1,
                “damage_max”: 16,
                “damage_type”: dmgCold,
                “damage_on_miss”: 0.5
        }
[a]I'm not yet solid on how this will work. I imagine that a spell card would have to function differently than an ability card, but without understand exactly how that would work, I can't set this one in stone just yet. For now, it's a categorization.
[b]The damage() method should call an attack() method that will calculate whether the attack lands or misses.
